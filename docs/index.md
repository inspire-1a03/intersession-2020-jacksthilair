## Day 1: Reflection
<!--
In this section, provide a ~250 word reflection on your first day of the module, and discuss why you're interested in this module and what you hope to take away from it.

You're also asked to insert a photo that represents your accomplishments on your first day. 
- Take a photo of you working or one of your circuits and upload it to the /docs/images/ folder of this repository. 
- Then, insert your photo into your document by modifying the markdown example that has been inserted below.
-->I have learned many things about programming on only the first day! All of this is super new to me and I have no prior experience with the content on the course. I find it super cool that on my first day I was able to create a website on GitHub. The website for GitHub its kind of confusing and daunting for someone who knows nothing about it. The way it was explained was very clear and made it possible to learn how to navigate the site. I am sure after working with it more I will learn how to use it better and implement more advanced ideas. I chose this course because I am not very experienced with computers and technology and I would love to learn new skills. So far from what I have done I can tell that I will expand my knowledge and be able to make things I never thought were possible before. Some things I would like to take away from this module is to have better skills with technology. Both my brother and my dad are very versed in computers, as my brother has a computer science minor, and my dad worked in computer security. The reason I took this course is because it was more hands on and I would be creating something interesting. I enjoy doing things that are more interactive and being able to see the finished product. The first day was fun yet a little bit frustrating because of my lack of knowledge in computers, but I look forward to the rest of the course!

## Day 2: Results
<!--/*
 * Inputs ADC Value from Thermistor and outputs Temperature in Celsius
 *  requires: include <math.h>
 * Utilizes the Steinhart-Hart Thermistor Equation:
 *    Temperature in Kelvin = 1 / {A + B[ln(R)] + C[ln(R)]3}
 *    where A = 0.001129148, B = 0.000234125 and C = 8.76741E-08
 *
 * These coefficients seem to work fairly universally, which is a bit of a 
 * surprise. 
 *
 * Schematic:
 *   [Ground] -- [10k-pad-resistor] -- | -- [thermistor] --[Vcc (5 or 3.3v)]
 *                                               |
 *                                          Analog Pin 0
 *
 * In case it isn't obvious (as it wasn't to me until I thought about it), the analog ports
 * measure the voltage between 0v -> Vcc which for an Arduino is a nominal 5v, but for (say) 
 * a JeeNode, is a nominal 3.3v.
 *
 * The resistance calculation uses the ratio of the two resistors, so the voltage
 * specified above is really only required for the debugging that is commented out below
 *
 * Resistance = PadResistor * (1024/ADC -1)  
 *
 * I have used this successfully with some CH Pipe Sensors (https://www.atcsemitec.co.uk/pdfdocs/ch.pdf)
 * which be obtained from https://www.rapidonline.co.uk.

Upload your fully-commented Arduino sketch from your final Day 2 build task--a thermometer connected to an RDB LED--into your GitHub repository.
Provide a short (~150 words) summary of your work on this circuit:
- How does your device work?
- What was challenging? 
- What worked? What didn't? 
- Be sure to link to your code (in your GitHub repository) in the text of your response.
--> This circuit I made serves a purpose to show a certain colour which represents the temperature. For example, I set it to display red if the temperature is greater than 30 degrees Celsius and to display green if the temperature is greater than 20 and less than 30. I found it easy to build the thermometer, but I made some crucial mistakes by using the potentiometer instead of the photoresistor. Other than this, Jay made it simple to follow along and was great at showing a tutorial on how to do it. It all worked but not after I had some slight modifications. I had to do different steps because I did not have a common anode. This made some of my steps different from where I had to plug in certain jumpers to different areas. For example, I had to plug it into ground for one of my jumpers. Making the circuit was a lot of fun and I never thought I would have been able to make something like this before this course.
