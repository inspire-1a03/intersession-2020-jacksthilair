Welcome to your project page for Electronics for the Rest of Us. You'll use this page to describe and showcase your work throughout the module. 
A place for each deliverable has been created below for you in this markdown document. 
Note that comments (such as this) will not appear in the final markdown document (which you can view with the "Preview" button).

## Day 1: Reflection
<!--
In this section, provide a ~250 word reflection on your first day of the module, and discuss why you're interested in this module and what you hope to take away from it.

You're also asked to insert a photo that represents your accomplishments on your first day. 
- Take a photo of you working or one of your circuits and upload it to the /docs/images/ folder of this repository. 
- Then, insert your photo into your document by modifying the markdown example that has been inserted below.
-->I have learned many things about programming on only the first day! All of this is super new to me and I have no prior experience with the content on the course. I find it super cool that on my first day I was able to create a website on GitHub. The website for GitHub its kind of confusing and daunting for someone who knows nothing about it. The way it was explained was very clear and made it possible to learn how to navigate the site. I am sure after working with it more I will learn how to use it better and implement more advanced ideas. I chose this course because I am not very experienced with computers and technology and I would love to learn new skills. So far from what I have done I can tell that I will expand my knowledge and be able to make things I never thought were possible before. Some things I would like to take away from this module is to have better skills with technology. Both my brother and my dad are very versed in computers, as my brother has a computer science minor, and my dad worked in computer security. The reason I took this course is because it was more hands on and I would be creating something interesting. I enjoy doing things that are more interactive and being able to see the finished product. The first day was fun yet a little bit frustrating because of my lack of knowledge in computers, but I look forward to the rest of the course!

## Day 2: Results
<!--
Upload your fully-commented Arduino sketch from your final Day 2 build task--a thermometer connected to an RDB LED--into your GitHub repository.
Provide a short (~150 words) summary of your work on this circuit:
- How does your device work?
- What was challenging? 
- What worked? What didn't? 
- Be sure to link to your code (in your GitHub repository) in the text of your response.
-->

## Arduino build-off results
<!--
Upload your fully-commented Arduino sketch from the final product of your Arduino build-off into the top-level of your module GitHub repository.
In ~300 words, provide a final device description and product pitch: 
- What does it do? Use a table (created in markdown) to list and describe the features. You can use the template provided below. 
- Describe briefly how it works.
- How could it be used in everyday life (or maybe just in rare cases)? 
- Be sure to link to your code (in your GitHub repository) in the text of your response.
- Include a snippet of code using the ``` ``` characters to display the code properly. 
Finally, record a short (30 second) video of a 'product pitch' for your device. 
- Upload the video to Youtube, and use the sample code below to embed your video.

Below is an example of embedding a YouTube video in a markdown document for use in GitHub pages. 
Note that this video won't show when previewing the document in GitHub--it only works on the GitHub pages webpage. 
- Once your YouTube video is uploaded, right click and select ```<> Copy embed code```. 
- You can paste this code directly into your markdown document. 
- Note that you may want to adjust the width and height parameters to make it fit well in your webpage
